/**
 * ! Chain of Responsibility Pattern
 * It's a behavioral design pattern that allows you to pass requests
 * along a chain of handlers.
 *
 * * It's useful when you need to process data in different ways, but you don't
 * * know in advance what type of processing is needed or in what order
 * * but you know it needs to be processed in sequence.
