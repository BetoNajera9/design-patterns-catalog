# Design patterns catalog

Design Patterns CatalogThis repository serves as a reference and learning resource for developers who want to understand, apply, and compare various design patterns in real-world scenarios.

The code is written in TypeScript, and we use Deno to run it. You can use Bun or Node if you prefer.

If you use Node, you will need to configure TypeScript, so I recommend Deno or Bun.
